# SNPhub
This is a collection of useful tools to deal with Illumina SNP chip data. It will include scripts to convert BLAST results from probe seqs against a reference genome and to convert these calls into a vcf
of known SNPs which can be used for donwstream tools such as GATK.

Other tools will allow to convert the SNP call matrix of a population into a numeric matrix and into hapmap format.
